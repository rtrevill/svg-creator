# SVG Logo Creator

## Link to Walkthrough Video:  



The task is to build a Node.js command-line application that takes in user input to generate a logo and save it as an SVG fileLinks to an external site.. The application prompts the user to select a color and shape, provide text for the logo, and save the generated SVG to a .svg file.


## User Story  
AS a freelance web developer  
I WANT to generate a simple logo for my projects  
SO THAT I don't have to pay a graphic designer  

## Acceptance Criteria  
GIVEN a command-line application that accepts user input  
WHEN I am prompted for text  
THEN I can enter up to three characters  
WHEN I am prompted for the text color  
THEN I can enter a color keyword (OR a hexadecimal number)  
WHEN I am prompted for a shape  
THEN I am presented with a list of shapes to choose from: circle, triangle, and square  
WHEN I am prompted for the shape's color  
THEN I can enter a color keyword (OR a hexadecimal number)  
WHEN I have entered input for all the prompts  
THEN an SVG file is created named `logo.svg`  
AND the output text "Generated logo.svg" is printed in the command line  
WHEN I open the `logo.svg` file in a browser  
THEN I am shown a 300x200 pixel image that matches the criteria I entered

Getting Started  
This Challenge combined many of the skills covered so far. In addition to the User Story and Acceptance Criteria, we’ve provided some guidelines to help you get started.

Because this Challenge requires a video submission, refer to the Full-Stack Blog video submission guideLinks to an external site. for guidance on creating and sharing a video.

Your application should use JestLinks to an external site. for running the unit tests and InquirerLinks to an external site. for collecting input from the user. The application will be invoked by using the following command:

node index.js
It is recommended that you start with a directory structure that looks like the following example:

.  
├── examples/           // Example svg file(s) created with the app  
├── lib/                // Folder for classes or functions  
    ├── shapes.js       // Exports `Triangle`, `Circle`, and `Square` classes  
    ├── shapes.test.js  // Jest tests for shapes  
    └── more...         // Additional files and tests  
├── .gitignore          // Indicates which folders and files Git should ignore  
├── index.js            // Runs the application using imports from lib/  
├── package.json  
└── README.md           // App description, link to video, setup and usage instructions    



IMPORTANT
Make sure that you remove dist from the .gitignore file so that Git will track this folder and include it when you push up to your application's repository.

The application must include Triangle, Circle, and Square classes, as well as tests for each of these classes using Jest. While not a requirement, it is recommended that you place any common functionality and properties shared by the Triangle, Circle, and Square classes in a parent Shape class and use inheritance to reuse the code in the child classes.

Each shape class should be tested for a render() method that returns a string for the corresponding SVG file with the given shape color.

The following example test should pass:

const shape = new Triangle();  
shape.setColor("blue");  
expect(shape.render()).toEqual('<polygon points="150, 18 244, 182 56, 182" fill="blue" />');  
You may need to add additional files in the lib folder for handling user input, writing to a file, etc. Writing tests for these additional files is optional.
